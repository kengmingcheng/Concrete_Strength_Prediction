# Concrete Strength Prediction

*.Implemented SHAP analysis for further model interpretability of complexity of neural networks.

*.Implemented Integrated Gradients(IG), by which influences represented by gradient change among pixels could be calculated, to research optimal concrete compositions.

*.Built custom optimizer for Tensorflow training model based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
