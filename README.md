# Concrete Strength Prediction

Implemented SHAP analysis for further model interpretability of complexity of neural networks.
Implemented Integrated Gradients(IG), by which influences represented by gradient change among pixels could be calculated, to research optimal concrete compositions.
Built custom optimizer for Tensorflow training model based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
Constructed AdaNet, which is capable of adding subnetworks to create a diverse ensemble, to achieve higher validation performance(around 0.05-0.1 of R-squared increment)
